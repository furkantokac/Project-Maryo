# Project-Maryo
Simplified version of Mario game writting in Python using PyGame. This project aims to beginner+ level coders that want to improve their knowledge with a practical example. So, I wrote a [guide](https://github.com/furkantokac/Project-Maryo/blob/master/extras/Project-Maryo_RehberV1.0_MetuNccAcm_TR.pdf) in Turkish that explains the project.

This project is tried to be written in a simplest way because it aims to begginer+ coders.
